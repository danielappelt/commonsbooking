A WordPress plugin for management and booking of commons goods. 

== Description ==

This plugin gives associations, groups and individuals the ability to share items (e.g. cargobikes, tools) with users. It is based on the idea of Commons and sharing resources for the benefit of the community. 

It was developed for the ["commons cargo bike" movement](http://www.wielebenwir.de/mobilitaet/free-nomadic-cargo-bikes-are-changing-the-urban-landscape) across Germany and Austria, but it can use it for any kind items.


**Unique features:**

* Items, locations and timeframes: No need for a "centralised storage", items can be assigned to different locations for the duration of a timeframe, each with their own contact information.  
* Simple booking process:  bookable timeframes can be configured with hourly slots oder daily slots. simple booking process for users: just click pickup and return date.
* Auto-accept bookings: A registered user can book items without the need for administration. 
* Codes: The plugin automatically generates booking codes, which are used at the station to validate the booking. 
* Managers can set holidays or repair slots to prevent items from beeing booked.


**Use cases:**

* You/your associations owns special tools that are not in use every day, and you want to make them available to a local group.
* You own a cargo bike that you want to share with the community, and it will be placed at different locations throughout the year.
